# “Billboard Hot 100: Historical Trends in Popular Music”
	
	This project will look at trends in the Billboard Hot 100 between 1958-2019. I want to use methods learned in this class to quantitatively analyze trends in popular music.

I will be presenting three analyses I ran in Python.

# How has the Billboard Hot 100 changed over time?

## 1)Value Counts by Year: "Saturation"
## 2)Career Length by Debut Year: "Longevity"
## 3)Jaccard Similarity: "Crowding/Turnover"



dataset from [data.world](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017)

packages: matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodel
 


# Motivation


	I listen to the radio in the car, and I get sick of overplayed songs on pop and hip-hop radio. My Suzuki is a prison, and Drake is a merciless warden. Was heavy saturation as significant in previous eras?


	I wanted to pick a topic that I was familiar with, and do things that I haven’t seen before. My first data-related love was sports statistics, and we don’t really talk about music the way we talk about sports. I think this is an interesting way to look at popular culture through an unbiased quantitative analysis. 

# Other Analyses

-Weeks on Chart by Artist- distribution
-Weeks on Chart by Song- distribution
-instances per song (Christmas)
-% of features by year (can build upon with market share of feature vs non-feature)
-“Chart-points” - overview, boxplots by artist + by song
-Unique Songs per year + unique songs per performer time-series, unique songs vs unique performers 
-per performer, distinct songs vs distinct weeks on chart or distinct years on chart (Glee)
-Performer weeks per song: boxplot, scatter vs # of unique songs (Neon Trees)
-Gini: overview, time-series of gini by performer and by song
-Unique years per performer (lifespan): scatter, mean by year, median by year. 
-Unique weeks per performer (lifespan): 
-Similarity index (set operations): boxplot, weekly plot, by-year means (12/5/98)
 -“Differential”: chart-points vs chart position (“country effect”)

I tried a lot of different analyses on this dataset: I'll leave my scrapped notebooks and revisit them at some point. This was a really fun project.
